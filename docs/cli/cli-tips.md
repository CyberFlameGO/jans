2. `--info` to get formations about some operations id for a specific task (ex; `opt/jans/jans-cli/config-cli.py --info User`)
3. `--operation-id` usage to operate each of the sub-task
4. `--endpoint-args` advanced usage for operation-id

## Patch Request (schema)

This schema file can be found in `/components/schemas/PatchRequest` for those which one support this operation.

When you examine this sample schema, you will see three properties in an object: op, path, and value.

* __op__: operation to be done, one of `add`, `remove`, `replace`, `move`, `copy`, `test`
* __path__: Path of the property to be changed. use path separator `/` for config or `.` for SCIM to change a property inside an object.
* __value__: New value to be assigned for each property defined in `path`
